/* WordPress Author Script: */
// If you don't want to define another alternative to the jQuery name.
// You really like to use $ and don't care about using another library's $ method
//
// jQuery that comes with WordPress automatically calls the jQuery.noConflict();
// function, which gives control of the $ variable back to whichever library
// that first implemented it.
//
// If you are loading a different copy of jQuery, you'll need to manually call
// jQuery.noConflict();, if necessary, from one of your JavaScript files.
//
// jQuery.noConflict();

// This is most frequently used in the case where you still want the benefits of really
// short jQuery code, but don't want to cause conflicts with other libraries.
